# PersonalSnakeGame

## Description

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python `turtle` module. The player controls a snake, navigating it to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.

    ```
    (Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your_repository_name
    ```
    (Replace `your_repository_name` with the name of the directory created after cloning)

## How to Play

Simply run the `main.py` file (or whatever you named your main game file) using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

A window will open, and you can start playing the Snake game!

Up Arrow: Move the snake upwards.
